          p Prioritizing scalability and modernity, we interpreted the ‘barber pole’ by stripping back the details. What remains is a bold, strong, yet whimsical emblem.  The expressive wavy form gives  movement to the ‘barber pole’ stripes - the upward direction lending to the aspirational feel we are looking to instill in the brand. We stuck with a serifed font - instantly recognized as astute & professional.
