        p(style="max-width: 70rem;") Tailored for sports marketers as the audience, our designs and infographics succinctly convey SAP's product benefits and outcomes.  We created a comprehensive system of iconography, typography, imagery, and color palettes to effectively convey SAP's offerings.  The products are inherently complex, requiring sales materials that effectively communicate their intricacies while staying on brand throughout.

        p(style="max-width: 70rem;") SAP is a purveyor of top-tier SAAS products, so  getting to know their offerings inside-out was a masterclass in the future of Data Driven CX.  As marketers, we learned so much.  As die-hard sports fans, it was just a blast to work with sports motifs throughout the visual language.
