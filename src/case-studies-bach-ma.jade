      p.title-1 Director Statement
      p.title-2 Art as meditation
      p.paragraph When I first arrived at Bach Ma Monastery I documented my learnings in essays and photographs, thoughts on the universal human experience of longing and grief.  I captured every angle of the place at a pace so deliberately slow and methodical, it became a meditative act. 
      p.paragraph Visual metaphors could be seen in the very fabric of the monastery’s way of life and its mise en scene. It became clear to me that the most effective medium to convey the story of this place was through film. After a spirited conversation about cinema with the master monk, we were granted permission to film in this idyllic and sacred setting. 
      p.paragraph The script inherits a layman’s point of view— touching upon themes such as the passing of time and what can be unearthed when we are stripped of our modern distractions and go deep into ourselves.  The storyline is based on true experience, while the visual abstractions invite reflection and contemplation of foundational Zen philosophies.

      p.title-2 Logline
      p.paragraph A woman decides to step out of her modern life and journeys to a remote monastery deep in the Bach Ma mountains of Vietnam, where she lives with a group of monks. Her silent struggle to adapt to the stoic and peculiar setting leads her to a wholehearted search for serenity.

      p.title-2 Fiction vs Documentary
      p.paragraph The film was conceived with the monastery's landscape and characters at its core, forging a unique blend of fiction and documentary, which lead us toward an immersive and realist style. As the monks maintained their daily rituals, we meticulously adjusted our schedules to work around theirs, ensuring an unfiltered portrayal of their authentic lives. Our approach was to integrate our lead actress into their world, casting her as a fictional character who would live in the very real world that is Bach Ma Monastery.

    .container.text-container
      p.paragraph This approach meant our script and filming had to be adaptable, responding to the conditions and opportunities that arose within this unique environment. As a mark of deep respect and commitment to preserving the monks' undisturbed routines, we frequently rehearsed and blocked scenes during the night and on off-hours. For group scenes, we captured the monks in their authentic moments, taking advantage of their regimented and repetitive schedules  to streamline our own production schedule.  
      p.paragraph We operated with utmost reverence, often communicating through whispers and hand signals.  Our all-female crew lived alongside the female monks in their serene convent, and participated in their daily routines. These routines centered around meditation, cooking, gardening, philosophical discourse, and chanting.  Through a minimalist lens and collaborative approach, we were fully immersing ourselves in the unique world we were dedicated to portraying on screen.

      p.title-1 Character
      p.title-2 Blurring The Lines
      p.paragraph The monks' unwavering commitment to their spiritual practice rendered them ideal background actors, seemingly undisturbed by the crew's presence. Their collective essence, marked by a methodical silence and stoic poise, enveloped the set to such an extent that our lead actor seamlessly immersed herself into the scene, both on and off camera, resulting in a method-like approach that brought authenticity and depth to her performance.

        p.title-2 The Friendly Guide
        p.paragraph A delightful and unexpected addition to our production was the monastery dog, Luto. He followed our production everywhere, through the forests and around the mountains. Initially, we tried to keep him out of the shots, but it became clear Luto intuited that both Kim and her character were on a journey and much in need of a guide. He became a cherished character, a statement to how friendship can soften even the most gruelling of endeavors.

        p.title-2 The Sound of Silence
        p.paragraph We recognized the immense value of capturing the essence of the ‘silence’ as a pivotal element in our film. The score and sound of BACH MA is a woven tapestry of the sounds of ethereal chanting, gentle chimes and resonating bells.  We meticulously recorded sounds of flowing water and all the life that exists in the surrounding forests. Every minute detail became vivid and pronounced. The score was purposefully crafted to provide the film with room to breathe and unfold, allowing its essence to resonate in the quietude of the monastery's setting.

        p.paragraph The monastery's master, a cinephile in his own right, meticulously oversaw the construction of the monastery to transform it into a picturesque masterpiece from every perspective. The symmetrical structures, adorned with intricate detailing, stand in harmonious contrast against the breathtaking backdrop of the natural setting. The beautifully maintained buildings provided an impeccable visual canvas for the film.

        p.title-2 Artistic Collaboration
        p.paragraph On a time constraint, we grappled with the challenge of executing three scenes in the script, each illustrating the intricate process of carving a wooden Buddha statue from its inception to completion—a task that typically spans several months.The artisans amongst the monks volunteered to have three separate statues crafted for us, each at a different stage of the carving process. This contribution to our film stood as a powerful testament to the way artistic collaboration can transcend the boundaries of language and culture.
