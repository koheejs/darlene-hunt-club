            <p>The Friendly Guide</p>
            <p>A delightful and unexpected addition to our production was the monastery dog, Luto. He followed our production everywhere, through the forests and around the mountains. Initially, we tried to keep him out of the shots, but it became clear Luto intuited that both Kim and her character were on a journey and much in need of a guide. He became a cherished character, a statement to how friendship can soften even the most gruelling of endeavors. </p>

            <p>The Sound of Silence</p>
            <p>We recognized the immense value of capturing the essence of the ‘silence’ as a pivotal element in our film. The score and sound of BACH MA is a woven tapestry of the sounds of ethereal chanting, gentle chimes and resonating bells.  We meticulously recorded sounds of flowing water and all the life that exists in the surrounding forests. Every minute detail became vivid and pronounced. The score was purposefully crafted to provide the film with room to breathe and unfold, allowing its essence to resonate in the quietude of the monastery's setting.</p>

            <p>The monastery's master, a cinephile in his own right, meticulously oversaw the construction of the monastery to transform it into a picturesque masterpiece from every perspective. The symmetrical structures, adorned with intricate detailing, stand in harmonious contrast against the breathtaking backdrop of the natural setting. The beautifully maintained buildings provided an impeccable visual canvas for the film.</p>

            <p>Artistic Collaboration</p>
            <p>On a time constraint, we grappled with the challenge of executing three scenes in the script, each illustrating the intricate process of carving a wooden Buddha statue from its inception to completion—a task that typically spans several months.The artisans amongst the monks volunteered to have three separate statues crafted for us, each at a different stage of the carving process. This contribution to our film stood as a powerful testament to the way artistic collaboration can transcend the boundaries of language and culture.</p>
